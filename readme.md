## Installation

1. Install npm and nodejs (hopefully you have these already)
2. Run `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server && npm install`


## Running the Dev Server

To start the dev server simply run `webpack-dev-server` from your nearest command line interface (note: you have to run it in this folder so it knows which webpack.config to load).
